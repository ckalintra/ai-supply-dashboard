Overview

This dashboard provides real-time sales insights and inventory recommendations powered by Supabase, Next.js, and Recharts. It aggregates sales and product data to generate actionable business intelligence helping teams forecast demand, prevent stockouts, and make data-driven decisions.

This project demonstrates:
-- Data-driven decision-making — transforming raw sales data into clear insights.
-- Scalable architecture — backend and frontend separation, optimized for analytics workloads.
-- Production-ready stack — built with TypeScript, Next.js API routes, and Supabase for instant deployability.
-- Real business value — improves operational efficiency by forecasting inventory health and sales trends.

Improvements:
-- Add AI-based demand forecasting (e.g., Prophet or LSTM model)
-- Include alerts system for low stock or high variance
-- Build a role-based dashboard (admin / sales / inventory)
-- Integrate CSV export and Slack alerts
-- Add unit and integration tests (Jest + Playwright)
-- Deploy CI/CD pipeline for continuous insights
